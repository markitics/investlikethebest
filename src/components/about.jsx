      <h1>What's this all about?</h1>
      <p>
        I have built a variety of tools over the years, for educational
        resources, for auto-playing (and editable) transcripts, for podcasters.
        I'm in that small group of ~20 people who show up for the sessions
        before the sessions at Podcast Movement (conference), discussing what
        changes to RSS spec would make most sense, for podcasters.
      </p>
      <p>
        The point of this website is to ask myself, how might I do it if
        starting from scratch today? In particular, how could richer transcripts
        fit into the existing Invest Like the Best workflow?
      </p>
      <h3>This is a live website</h3>
      <p>
        It's my birthday on Tuesday, and I'm taking much of the week offline to
        be with parents and siblings â€“ first such gathering since March! Even
        without hearing form you (Damian/Patrick), I will likely come back and
        make a few tweaks before the end of the week. I'm deploying this v1
        Sunday 16th, but it might (or might not!) look different next weekend â€“
        depending on what else I have going on ðŸ˜Š
      </p>
      <h3>Setting expectations</h3>
      <p>
        This is a bit of weekend fun for me, as a fan of the podcast. I'm not
        looking for a job, so am surely not the best choice for a key role in
        any new venture. I hope to be of help if I can lend an occasional hand!
        I hack on this sort of thing for fun, and would be glad to be more
        involved with the Invest Like the Best universe!
