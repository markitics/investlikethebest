[Episode 181]

2
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:57,730
Patrick: My guest this week is Charlie Songhurst the former head of strategy at Microsoft, and a prolific investor having personally invested in nearly 500 companies through his career.

3
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,130
I met Charlie at an event hosted in New York.

4
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,459
And you can tell within one minute of meeting him that his mind is sparkling with ideas and curiosity.

5
00:01:05,179 --> 00:01:08,150
It's no wonder he's been among the most commonly requested guests.

6
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,570
When I asked several top investors and CEOs who I should have on the show, Charlie’s name always comes up.

7
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,130
Charlie, I like starting these things in a unique way.

8
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:33,420
And one idea that you've had is to have people stack rank their vices of power, money, and fame.

9
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,929
I'd love you to begin by explaining why you're interested in this idea and what you've learned from the answers over the years.

10
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:47,199
Charlie: So, it's a two part question, one is stack ranking the virtues: [1] working with people you like; [2] working on amazing problems; and [3] having impact.

11
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,860
And then the three vices: [1] power, [2] money; and [3] fame.

12
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,160
You can't avoid them, but they have to be viewed separately.

13
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,179
And it's really trying to get at the differences between them.

14
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:59,170
There's no good answer, but there are definite good fit answers.

15
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,509
So, someone who's interested in power tends to be better at execution.

16
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:10,310
Someone's more interested in money, tends to think more about some capital efficiency.

17
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:16,109
I tend to avoid people interested in fame, but if you are doing something in showbiz, it would presumably be the number one criteria.

18
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:25,019
If you think about the difference between impact, intellectual interest, working with people, you really get impression of where people are going to be happy and where they're not going to be happy.

19
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,830
You also start to understand why certain organizations do so well.

20
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,470
So, SpaceX if you think about it, stacks high on all three.

21
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,730
It's intellectually interesting.

22
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,930
You're working with amazing people.

23
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:35,950
You have huge utilitarian impacts in the world.

24
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,719
Whereas if you're working at a FinTech, you're less likely to survive that utilitarian positive impact.

25
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:46,870
Patrick: Any especially memorable or interesting series of answers that you've gotten on the two stack ranks that come to mind?

26
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,350
Charlie: A lot of people have negative utility from fame.

27
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:58,189
A lot of people start with power and then when you push them it's actually money but they don't want to say it.

28
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:03,060
This is more true outside of the US culture than it is in the US.

29
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,680
It's particularly true with Europeans.

30
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:12,769
And so a lot of it is trying to get people to actually say what they truly believe, as opposed to say what they think they should say.

31
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:21,299
Patrick: I'm curious in what context, whether it be interviewing prospective founders, interviewing potential hires or others you find it most interesting and useful?

32
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,309
Charlie: All of the above, especially the founder.

33
00:03:23,309 --> 00:03:29,400
One is fascinating because you actually end up going down different lines and helping them depending on whether they answer power or money.

34
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:34,700
Founders that answer power tend to need help more on managing the startup capital efficiently.

35
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,530
They tend to be the ones that spend more.

36
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,799
They tend to be the ones that over expand that are often too aggressive.

37
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:54,710
Conversely, the ones that answer money tend to be very capital efficient, but often, slightly too cautious, slightly under aggressive, sometimes not willing enough to stamp their authority on the company and make it the culture that it needs to be to be successful.

38
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,049
Patrick: When it comes to hiring or evaluating founders.

39
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:04,130
Apart from this two-part stack ranking, are there other favorite questions or devices that you return to again and again?

40
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,890
Charlie: I think what you're looking for is founder market fit.

41
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,960
I think there's a sort of mistaken concept.

42
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,260
That's this Platonic ideal of an entrepreneur.

43
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,469
But I think maybe there's two very basic things, this energy and this sort of cognitive ability.

44
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,909
But after that, you're really looking for fit.

45
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:25,070
So, if you take the sort of prototypical consumer founder, they tend to have more empathy for how people behave.

46
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:34,240
Whereas if you take the classic enterprise founder, they tend to be more rational because in some ways you can just go and ask your customers what features do you want and go build them.

47
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,460
And so you go down those different lines.

48
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,570
And I think there's a lot of fallacy in that sort of platonic ideal.

49
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,150
What you're actually looking for is someone who's a good fit for a business.

50
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,670
Patrick: I'd love to take a step back now and introduce you to the audience a little bit.

51
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:55,980
One device that I've been using with people on the podcast is to ask you to give the thumbnail two minutes sketch of your life and career up until this point.

52
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,510
Charlie: I studied politics, philosophy, and economics at Oxford.

53
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:07,660
Ended up at McKinsey, then Microsoft, and then sort of bumbled my way into becoming an investor and do a lot of angel investing.

54
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:15,270
So I think I've done about 500 angel investments, the actual numbers is 483, and about 300 in the portfolio at the moment.

55
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,200
Patrick: I believe you ran strategy at Microsoft.

56
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,989
What exactly did that entail?

57
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,570
And what is most memorable about that time?

58
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,850
Charlie: There's so many memories working with amazing people.

59
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:35,880
The hostile acquisition of Yahoo as an attempt was just unbelievably intellectually fascinating, trying to buy a company in a hostile position for I think it was 47 billion dollars.

60
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:47,219
And just the drama and the soap opera and realizing how much path dependency matters in big deals, how much a casual comment misinterpreted by one side or the other actually, actually changes the outcome.

61
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:57,299
It's remarkable how little system theory that is in the sense of you ran experiments again, and again, I think you'd get a lot of different results in M&A activity.

62
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:02,170
Where in things like product usage, good products and bad products, that could probably be the same niche experiment.

63
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,770
Patrick: 483 investments is a crazy amount.

64
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,380
I want to come back to your time at Microsoft probably later on and talk in more depth about strategy.

65
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:20,050
But given the sheer volume of investments that you've made, I think a great place to begin our conversation is your idea or your thinking around why startups succeed and fail.

66
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,440
I'd love to begin by you outlining sort of what, if anything is shared in common across those 483.

67
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:32,880
So are there certain features that you're always looking for and sort of how your process works and then we'll get into the success and failure of startups.

68
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,849
Charlie: In some ways the two tie together.

69
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:40,380
So I think the dominant sort of failure mode for startups is the same at each different stage.

70
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:49,119
So at sort of pre seed to seed, you basically have a failure to achieve labor productivity, which is just a polite way of saying the team doesn't come together.

71
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,769
Doesn't gel and produce good output.

72
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:58,390
Usually a team that just produces good work will generate enough sort of kinetic energy to get continuing funding.

73
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:05,349
Once you sort of going from seed to series A, it's another single cause, which is failure to get product market fit.

74
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,580
You're basically on the search for demand curve.

75
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,200
And you either find one where you don't find one.

76
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,040
And this is where you've got the highest element of pure chance in a start up.

77
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:20,469
It's always feels akin to sort of gold perspective in the California gold rush, which is you can be good or you can be bad.

78
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:21,690
You can do the right thing.

79
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,203
You can do the wrong thing, but there's some irreducible amount of chance.

80
00:07:25,203 --> 00:07:31,190
Why the wisest prospector with the best maps, the most intelligent strategy, sometimes just won't find it.

81
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,530
And someone will just fall asleep, put the pan in a stream and gold will come out.

82
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,780
And there really is a little nexus of serendipity at this stage.

83
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:53,120
Then when you move to series A, it's really all about labor productivity, but in a different form, it's “can the manager scale?” And one of the fallacies is most early stage startup founders think they're managers.

84
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,340
And their actually not.

85
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,830
What the actually have is a team that's actually managing them.

86
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:06,929
Because when you're managing say 10 or less people and spending time with them every day, what's actually happening is they're managing you by influence because they know you well enough.

87
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,800
And they talked to you enough to work out what your desires are.

88
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:15,289
So as long as you're articulate and energetic and sort of engaged, you actually don't have to manage.

89
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,620
The team manages you up.

90
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:26,080
But when you scale to 30 people, to 90 people or above, you no longer have those personal connections, you have to move to formal management techniques.

91
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,850
And that's like a sort of Fermi Paradox Great Filter.

92
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,249
It wipes up an amazing amount of startups.

93
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:36,309
And the way that's done is a collapse in the labor productivity per person.

94
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,900
There's a term in micro economics called managerial diseconomies of scale.

95
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:49,050
And I think in some ways the angle of the decline of productivity per person is the difference between the sort of the Stripes, the great startups, and the failures.

96
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:54,799
And maybe if you're a great startup, as you go from 10 people to 100 people output per person drops 15%.

97
00:08:55,179 --> 00:09:06,200
And if you're a bad startup, it actually drops over 90% with the result that often 100-person startups produce the less than they did when they had 10 people, because the managerial collapse has been so extreme.

98
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:24,920
And one interesting thing is if you could look at companies that get big, maybe there's a sort of interesting explanation where one of the shared attributes was an instinct for the sort of structures and processes and management that were shared between Gates, Zuckerberg, Bezos, the Collisons - all these sort of super talented people, because my guess is they didn't receive formal instruction on it.

99
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,610
That VC as an advisors weren't that helpful on it.

100
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,529
It may be either by chance or by skill.

101
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,877
They just intuited the way through it.

102
00:09:31,877 --> 00:09:36,840
Then when you get beyond that sort of series B and beyond, I think it's institution building.

103
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:45,970
And one of the interesting problems is the sort of people that become entrepreneurs often full of energy and sort of flexibility – almost a sort of combination of streets smart and book smart.

104
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:52,200
But there's a point where they've hit product market fit, where actually what they're doing is repeating a process at scale.

105
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,480
And to repeat a process at scale, you need to build an institution.

106
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:59,219
And often that sort of is almost an anathematic to their personality.

107
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,330
If they've ever taken revenue from 42 countries, you really need a well developed finance department.

108
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:22,829
Once you get to a certain size, you will always be in court cases because of being sued by ex-employees, you'll have patent infringement suits, you'll be debt collecting customers that didn't pay, the shift to sort of building an institution with institutional norms, and institutional boundaries and institutional culture, all the boring stuff of building.

109
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,530
From finance departments, from legal departments, from HR department.

110
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,440
That again is a big filter.

111
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,879
And so those are sort of filters by stages.

112
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:33,250
What's interesting is some of those you can do when you meet someone pre-seed.

113
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,650
One interesting thing is, can I close my eyes and imagine this person on a public company conference call.

114
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,890
Remembering my days at Microsoft, as in the Microsoft earnings call.

115
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:54,089
And I'm thinking, can I imagine them sitting as a sort of CEO, next to their CFO, talking with all the sort of wall street equity analysts and the buy side on the phone and just being credible enough, deep enough, and mature enough to pull that off.

116
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:56,320
Patrick: It's a fascinating set of framing.

117
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:14,079
The one that jumps out as maybe most interesting to me is this idea of the declining curve of people's productivity and in your experience, whether or not that is something that is typically innate to the founder, meaning they just handle that naturally and with aplomb, or if instead it's something perhaps that could be coached.

118
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:19,000
And if it's really just a set of best practices that are fairly universal, that the founders just don't get.

119
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,800
Charlie: I think the irony is it is absolutely something that can and should be coached, but often isn't.

120
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:30,370
So, often the people that get it intuitively are the people that survive, but there's no need for that.

121
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,850
It can just be coached in.

122
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,499
And I think a lot of it is you get this very strong transition.

123
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:41,240
When you are a very small startup, most of the people you're employing just come in, do their job and go home.

124
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:47,020
And the drawback of that is you tend to end up having to do tight management, a lot of micromanagement.

125
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,980
And the beauty of it is you tend to get a very low level politics in the organization.

126
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:59,210
Then you get this transition to where you’re hiring people that are sort of execs, so would be the sort head hunted: VPs, senior people.

127
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:08,200
And the beauty of these more senior people is you can give them much more complex tasks: build me a product division doing this, go open European markets for me.

128
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:17,319
The drawback is it anyone capable of those complex conceptual abstractions necessarily to do that, tends also to be capable of politics.

129
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:24,630
And because the world is not composed of saints as an organization scales the level of politics increases exponentially.

130
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:34,100
Someone once said to me the difference between a great company, as one where the exact spend only 25% of the time playing politics and a bad one is where they spend 50% of the time playing politics.

131
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,910
And that delta is the entire gaussian bell-curve from the best Fortune 500 company to the worst.

132
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:44,800
And I think one of the things that really matter as a founder is acting as a dampener on politics.

133
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:51,750
Reducing the tendency for marketing to try and take control of the sales funnel.

134
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:57,140
Reducing the tendency for the head of sales to want to take over sort of inbound marketing.

135
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:04,000
It's trying to stop the CFO controlling spending so tightly that you don't get positive return on capital investments by sales.

136
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,429
It’s trying to stop sales, having so much control over spending that your margins get out of control.

137
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:17,969
All those boundary conditions between sort of VP leaders and functional heads, defining those well and managing through that transition is just so important.

138
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,009
And there's no where someone learns that through the process of entrepreneurship.

139
00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:30,719
One of the things that's, I think very interesting in people's careers in general, is the early stages, and the personalities that go into them often have negative correlation with the later stages.

140
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:39,710
So, if you look at a sort of McKinsey or Goldman Sachs analyst, often what they need is attention to detail, strong work ethic, high diligence, high conscientiousness.

141
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,650
Those sorts of things.

142
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:55,840
If you look at middle management at those companies, they need good project management, good ability to abstract and structure problems, good ability to pull a team together and create team moral and the sort of attention to the detail and the technical knowledge matters less.

143
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:05,879
And then if you look at the sort of partner level in those firms, often all that matters is relationship building and sales and charm, and the ability to empathize with the client and connect with them.

144
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:11,670
And so it's very hard to find people that are stars in all three parts of those careers.

145
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:14,170
And I think it's the same with entrepreneurship.

146
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:38,680
The street smart entrepreneur at sort of pre-seed who can raise money with a good narrative, and good energy and recruit people and sort of create a sort of sense of momentum and a esprit de corps, is often very negatively correlated with a sort of personality that wants to put in quarterly HR reviews and QBR reporting, and really make sure that the finance team is taking off at a later stage.

147
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:53,600
And then conversely, often the entrepreneurs that do very well later find the early stage capital raising hell on earth, because in some ways they are so tightly gripped to reality and slightly pessimistic, which makes them fairly good at sort of avoiding chaos, often makes them very bad at pitching.

148
00:14:54,550 --> 00:15:18,589
Patrick: I'd love to hear your thought on this interesting concept that actually our mutual friend Graham and I have batted around quite a lot, which is this notion, the term we use based on a blog post by a guy named Rick Burton is the idea of an “alien founder.” An alien here is used as the best possible compliment to a founder where it's somebody that just has sort of what seems to be in like an unfair and privileged access to some sort of underlying substrate - the thing that is going to build the business.

149
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,350
And they just kind of know what to do.

150
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:25,459
They have an incredible first principles mindset typically, and say, Bill Gates would be a great example of this.

151
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,260
I think Bezos would be a great example of this, to use obvious ones.

152
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:35,040
What do you think of that idea that in some ways the absolute best founders are in some sense, alien, and distinctly unique people.

153
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:50,170
Charlie: I will, maybe for the Socratic sake of it, sort of take the opposite argument and say, I think one of the mistakes to fall into is just sort of seeing a sort of effervescent genius because you're seeing people at the height of their powers, you're not seeing them on the way up.

154
00:15:50,370 --> 00:16:03,989
That's that famous clip of Bezos, I think in 1999, with Amazon spray painted in the back of the office, it would be really interesting if you talk to him, whether he is similar to the Bezos of today.

155
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:23,240
Because in the intervening 20 years, remember, you've got this incredible training program for the mind: they are working every hour in the startup, they're talking with the smartest people, they're constantly getting new information, they're hiring, they're firing, that pattern recognition of the executives get so much better.

156
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,420
They've got a million failed initiatives.

157
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,790
So they have all these learnings of what not to do.

158
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:32,130
They've got all the things that have worked, they’ve seen the scale, they've seen the commonality.

159
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:41,509
And so how much of that is sort of looking at an athlete at the peak of that performance and not seeing the 10,000 hours of practice that got them there.

160
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:51,440
And I can almost argue, you could invert it and say, what are actually the causes of mortality and how do we just avoid suffering that mortality this year?

161
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,490
And if you survive long enough, maybe greatness eventually becomes you.

162
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:09,630
One of the things I think that sort of is perhaps underestimated, is if you want to live forever, maybe don't start thinking about studying centenarians, instead, work out how to not die of a DUI or drunk driving or anybody else smoking 20 cigarettes a day.

163
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:17,550
And to some extent, the same in entrepreneurship, is people spend a lot of time studying greatness.

164
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,650
They don't study failure.

165
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:19,850
They study Mohammed Ali.

166
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:23,959
They don't study all the heavyweight boxers that faked out after losing that first match.

167
00:17:24,379 --> 00:17:28,409
But maybe if you study all of those, you can find a commonality in their mistake.

168
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,790
Maybe they will, I don't know, offered their chin to the opponents or something.

169
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,060
And in startups, I think there are common mistakes.

170
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,770
There's an original sin about capitalism.

171
00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:48,210
I see so many startups, three to five years in it's still haunted by bad capital at the beginning, some investor they don't want, some valuation that was hopelessly dilutive and puts VCs off.

172
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:54,700
Often one of the things that I see correlate very well with successes is how quickly they exit their first employee that doesn't fit.

173
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:02,270
And I think what that's actually showing is are they willing enough to be disagreeable, to make the company what they want?

174
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:10,050
And so the willingness to cross the chasm, and often you're dealing with young founders, that's a major inflection point.

175
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:15,770
And if you don't do it that often leads to a toxic culture and bad results, then that's sort of more subtle maladies.

176
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:28,930
Like turning things into an academic project, particularly with founders with very strong academic backgrounds, often in deep tech and PhDs, that's sort of like generals fighting the last war, where they think prestige of a currency because it is an academia.

177
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:40,530
And so they just think if we do amazing work and we tell the world about that amazing work, good things will happen because as a holistic, that did work, but it means they don't engage with the revenue, they don't get quite product market fit.

178
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:49,960
It's too much a sort of ivory tower, intellectual exercise, or conversely, do they just sort of think we get momentum, we get revenue, we get traction – it'll work.

179
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:54,960
And they haven't really thought about the micro economics and unit economics of a scaling company.

180
00:18:55,150 --> 00:19:02,850
And so, I almost invert it and say, don't study greatness, study failure, and work out how not to be that.

181
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:11,200
If you're sort of thinking of history, trying to be as good an Emperor as Augustus would be really difficult, but not being as incompetent as Caligula seems really easy.

182
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:19,970
And so as a practical advice, not making the catastrophic mistakes and just surviving long enough feels like a good strategy.

183
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:24,820
There was some military general somewhere that said: “it's not that good soldiers become veterans.

184
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:33,909
It's the lucky soldiers become veterans, but veterans are good soldiers.” Meaning just the luck of surviving the first few hours put you up an experience curve.

185
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:39,580
And I see entrepreneurs transform in those first 36 months of leadership and management.

186
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,879
And half of it is just stay alive till you get good.

187
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,139
Patrick: We've talked a little bit about recruiting.

188
00:19:45,149 --> 00:20:00,490
That's someone that all of a sudden seems like half of my time is spent just recruiting people in all different directions, curious how early you encourage entrepreneurs to make that a major part of what they do and whether or not that effectively lasts the rest of their career if they're successful.

189
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:06,920
Charlie: So I think recruiting is way underestimated precisely because in an early company, people replicate themselves.

190
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:16,590
So because people tend to hire not so much in their own image, but with that own set of biases, all the initial people you hire will influence all the other hires.

191
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:21,300
And so you can either get this sort of upwards iterating culture of excellence.

192
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,710
Or you can get this downwards iterating culture of excellence.

193
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,210
So those first few hires are utterly critical.

194
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:36,910
And I think people way in the estimate, just the sort of the math of the return which is, it seems excessive to say, spend 100 hours hiring a person.

195
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:43,500
But if you're only hiring 10 people, that person has 10% of the output of your company for the next seven years, if they stay.

196
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:55,360
But then if they hire as well, they may actually contribute to 10% of the productivity of the company for the first decade, both by their own labors in the early years, but also in terms of the way they themselves recruit.

197
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:07,629
So I think people just underestimate the power of the math here, and don't focus on the bias that entrepreneurs often have of going for speed and the desire to move fast.

198
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,639
And partly this has sort of come out of startup culture because of the sort of synergies of network effect businesses.

199
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,280
Where speed often really does matter.

200
00:21:16,389 --> 00:21:22,680
But 99% of startups don't have strong network effects, 80% don't have them at all, maybe 90% only have weak network effects.

201
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,880
And in those quality matters far more.

202
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:42,550
And so going slower, spending an enormous amount of time, picking exceptional people that are deeply synergetic, exceptional in and of themselves, and then have deep and meaningful synergies with the other team members, creates this thing, which is a sort of algebraic functional labor output.

203
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:52,500
And I almost think that's how you have to think in the first year: “how do I find amazing standard on people that are also synergetic so that my net labor output of the firm is super high.”

204
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:58,550
And the biggest mistake I see, is when the panic to hire someone because they need sort of a job done.

205
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,949
And so they just go for the earliest person.

206
00:22:02,949 --> 00:22:09,319
Another pernicious mistake, is the change in hiring rate based on the amount of capital available to the startup.

207
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:14,830
So what you notice is hiring is not consistent on a quarter by quarter basis.

208
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:23,760
It bulges after each capital raise – pre-seed, seed, A, and B – and then it's attenuated to almost to nothing in the six months before the next capital raise.

209
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:31,480
So the sort of entrepreneur is like the proverbial sailor coming into port who spends all their money and then doesn't have any money months afterwards.

210
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:35,020
And if you think about that, that's absolutely insane.

211
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:47,420
Because what's the chance that you can find, say you’re hiring 10 people, what's the chance you can find eight in the first 90 days and then only find two in the next 540 days?

212
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:53,220
Your chance of coming across the exceptional people is so much lower than if you space that out evenly.

213
00:22:53,550 --> 00:23:04,749
And, because you'll know the existing people and see them working together, if you hire two in that first quarter, each next one you hire, you will understand the synergies with the existing team so much more.

214
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:12,600
Patrick: What have you seen successful founders do to make sure that when recruiting they're able to win the best candidates out there.

215
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,730
So it's one thing to be patient and spend the time to identify them.

216
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:22,249
You also have to hold out an attractive proposition to those very talented people who presumably have other opportunities as well.

217
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,960
So what have you learned about the best recruiters in terms of how they market the opportunity and market the firm?

218
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,695
Charlie: I'll give sort of base cynical answer and then a more aspirational answer.

219
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,039
The cynical one is just being in a labor market with sort of low competition.

220
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:45,800
You really don't want to be sitting there in San Francisco trying to close your candidate when John Collison’s trying to close the candidate as the alternative, because John's going to win.

221
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,090
Patrick: Knowing John, I agree.

222
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,399
Charlie: He is one of the great execs at his age.

223
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,590
But you see this actually happen.

224
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:59,290
Where, if you're hiring that person in Kiev and their other option is working in outsourced IT for Deutsche Bank, it's a much, much easier win.

225
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:05,560
So in some ways, what you want to find is where are the incredibly qualified people in weakly competitive labor markets.

226
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:10,580
And that is a much easier filter than actually being good at recruiting and a much more powerful one.

227
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:16,780
You're much better off being a heavyweight box whose not very good fighting lightweight boxers than you are getting good at being a heavyweight boxer.

228
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:25,360
So, you're better going and competing in a market where the other recruiters are lightweight because they're boring industrial firms with tenure based promotions.

229
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,530
So that's one.

230
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:34,280
And then two, it's some combination of sort of painting a vision that people want to be part of, understanding why they themselves are motivated.

231
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,209
So it goes back to those sort of earlier questions.

232
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,990
Are they motivated by working with great people?

233
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,889
Are they motivated by utilitarian impact?

234
00:24:39,899 --> 00:24:42,180
Are they're motivated by things like money and power?

235
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:46,249
It goes back to just getting the impression that they want to spend time with you.

236
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,369
Do they actually want to spend every day with you as a founder because these companies are small.

237
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,600
It's not like you're recruited by a big company.

238
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,330
And the hiring VP, you may be going to spend an hour a month with, you're going to spend a lot of time with the founder.

239
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,220
So there has to be an actual desire to do this.

240
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:07,070
And then third, I think there's just a sort of sense of being in a sort of gang that's going to succeed.

241
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:09,210
A sense of - we are happy for you.

242
00:25:09,389 --> 00:25:22,140
Let's quote some Shakespeare of just “I want to be with this because this is going to be something that changes the world, and it's going to be an adventure and fun.” And that cliché, the journey will be the reward, will be true and the economic outcome will be a reward.

243
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,439
And when I look back to impact, we'll have a reward.

244
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,225
And if you get that triple threat, you'll close them.

245
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:26,563
West Coast vs.

246
00:25:26,563 --> 00:25:27,127
East Coast: Investing and Culture

247
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:38,220
Patrick: I would love your take on the sort of interesting tension between what I'll call in the US sort of East Coast versus West Coast investing where I would say East Coast investing is very traditional wall street, more quantitative.

248
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:45,560
Where West Coast is more startup-y and technology, and more qualitative and almost cavalier about, in some cases about the quantitative aspect of things.

249
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:50,920
I'd love you to riff on the pros and cons of these two styles and where you see the appropriate mix of them.

250
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,889
Charlie: I think this is sort of multi-part explanation for that.

251
00:25:54,010 --> 00:26:04,599
One part, I think is the absence of existing status hierarchies on the West Coast meant there was less of an opportunity cost and sort of not joining Goldman.

252
00:26:04,949 --> 00:26:13,300
And you could almost do a counter history and say maybe all the story about DARPA and the Valley and all of that is much less important than people think.

253
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:24,250
Maybe you just have a new country formed of 70 to 100 million people, without an existing status hierarchy, it would obviously glom on to the new tech, to the new industry.

254
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,540
The new industry is obviously going to be tech.

255
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:35,770
And so it was obvious that our sort of new country, which is really what the West Coast has been since sort of World War II when you at just the population numbers, the West Coast would obviously win.

256
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:36,790
That's one part of it.

257
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,100
[“I'm not sure you can build trillion-dollar market cap companies without that high trust culture.”]

258
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:41,159
I think the second part is differences in the nature of trust and zero sum-ness.

259
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:45,130
Partly because financial markets are in the traditional sense zero-sum.

260
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:48,590
One person’s stock alpha is another person's negative alpha.

261
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:54,770
East Coast investing has this sort of sense of, I need to beat the other person, I need to get a deal.

262
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,569
And that has led to sort of lower trust between participants.

263
00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:08,030
And the West Coast maybe it's sort of part of California, hippie culture tradition coming in, has this very high sense of trust.

264
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:16,490
And if you look at these – the convertible note, if you look at the sort of letting the founder make decisions without supervision – these things can only emerge in a very high trust culture.

265
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:22,940
I'm not sure you can build trillion dollar market cap companies without that high trust culture.

266
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,639
I think if you don't have it.

267
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:31,290
You end up building something with a billion dollars and then arguing over how to sell it or how to optimize it.

268
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:39,169
And you don't get that sort of, “je ne sais quoi” aspiration that you see in all the trillion market cap companies, all of which are on the West Coast.

269
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:52,020
And then I think there's some interesting little sort of cultural foibles possibly with an actual dress by the East and West Coast, but more by the nature of investing, maybe what people do as analysts between the age of 21 and 23.

270
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:59,540
So if you spend your time between 21 and 23 building Excel models, you tend to think more about numbers.

271
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:03,159
And so you tend to have a much better intuition for margin economics.

272
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:13,419
And so where is the East coast often right over the West about the way they look at businesses, it's they correctly identify businesses with shaky unit economics, but fast revenue growth and “good” product market fit.

273
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:18,470
And they're like: “Look, you have product-market fit, but only because you're giving away $100 to 90.

274
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,159
So of course you've got good product market fit.”

275
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:36,090
I'll give the sort of counterpoint where West Coast investors do very well, is where you have a product lead that doesn't get evinced in the numbers immediately, but it's such a sort of tactile and visceral experience when you use it, you have to make an imaginative leap to turn that into numbers.

276
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,270
And there are two examples.

277
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,040
One is the iPhone, and I was doing some investigations for Microsoft at the time.

278
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:46,719
And it was always easier to talk back competitors than talk about yourself because you're less likely to say something you shouldn't.

279
00:28:46,949 --> 00:28:50,300
So you always try and steer the conversation to talking about Apple, Google or something.

280
00:28:50,300 --> 00:29:06,459
And one of the things you realized is there was a bunch of investors that sort of thought Apple was overvalued when it was sort of a hundred, 200 billion market cap, because they took the TAM of Nokia and said, even if they take all Nokia's market share, this business can't be big because phones only sell whatever it was back then.

281
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:13,470
And they couldn't intuit the increase in pricing power that were are going to get from turning the phone into a computer.

282
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,163
And the West Coast, VC community immediately intuited that.

283
00:29:16,163 --> 00:29:21,670
And then you see the same in this sort of almost comic battle over Tesla as a stock.

284
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,850
The Apple one, we can say it's a win on the West Coast.

285
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,820
The Tesla story isn't fully written yet.

286
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:34,616
But again, it's this difference between a culture that says look, this product is so amazing, it will define its own category, and other investors saying, when you look at this in a spreadsheet, it just doesn't work.

287
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:43,675
And I think one interesting thing in general in the search for alpha, is where do you get intuitions that are hard to make because there's no natural person to think of it.

288
00:29:43,675 --> 00:29:48,400
There's a public company called Xero, which is a small business accounting company.

289
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,490
It's headquartered in New Zealand listed on the ASX.

290
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,770
It's biggest market is accounting software in the UK.

291
00:29:55,770 --> 00:30:10,429
But the people that fundamentally understand accounting software, would be people that have followed Intuit, which is a West Coast NASDAQ listed stock, would be more the people that maybe look at Intuit, H&R Block, that maybe go into Tableau and business analytics, right?

292
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:15,150
And so then you had a company [Xero] that quietly went from 50 million market cap to 10 billion market cap.

293
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:26,560
And I'm not sure anyone intuited it, because New Zealand investors weren’t use to tech, the Australian investors came out of a sort of mining culture and the US investors tended not to look at ASX listed companies.

294
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,619
And so one thing that's taught me, is trying to be smarter than other people is very hard and it doesn't work very often.

295
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:37,730
Trying to have an insight that you get because you sit in a different information flow just seems exponentially easier.

296
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,160
[Qualitative vs.

297
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,165
Quantitative Approaches]

298
00:30:39,165 --> 00:30:46,500
Patrick: Everything you highlight suggests exactly what's happened in the last 10 years, which is that the primary sin for public market investors is being overly quantitative.

299
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:59,470
That basically anything quantitative, whether pure quantitative strategies or people that rely heavily on spreadsheets, as you say, have tended to get trounced by people that have the more qualitative, fundamental insight about what will become a very big market.

300
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:04,790
I'm curious how you apply those concepts in your own style of investing at an earlier stage.

301
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:08,480
So where does, obviously there's a lot of qualitative, but where does the quantitative come to play?

302
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:26,790
Charlie: Let me just go a little bit further on the thoughts of that, which is, I think one thing that's very interesting is the way you model companies in Excel with a DCF, there's this sort of set of cultural norms, like trending down the growth rate to a terminal value over time that obviously we collect for industrial era companies.

303
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,139
The sort of companies that are KKR would buy.

304
00:31:29,209 --> 00:31:31,540
You were sort of modeling Nabisco and Barbarians at the Gate.

305
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:45,609
It's obviously the right conceptual . Maybe that's just not right for network effects businesses because instead, literally, how do you model an Excel the concept of in year six, something becomes a standard and therefore gets sustained to accelerating growth.

306
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:49,000
There was some sort of joke in the eighties that you'd never get fired for buying IBM.

307
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:54,440
Well maybe in 2006, it suddenly became you never got fired for buying salesforce.com.

308
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:58,179
How do you model in that as a concept?

309
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:11,290
Suddenly kicking into revenue growth, maybe what you should actually be doing is writing the sort of 3,000 word essay on revenue growth drivers, as opposed to sort of trending down over time as an automatic default.

310
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:17,350
So there's sort of certain things where I think the industrial era protocols actually just mislead you.

311
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:30,350
Conversely, I think the counterpoint to that, which is the sort of two product driven mistake, is when you look for network effects everywhere and you sort of assume they exist and actually you're just getting into it standard competitive market.

312
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:41,259
Trying to turn that to start-up investing, I think a fairly good rule of thumb is to think, it's very hard to extract economic gains to get revenue without solving someone's problem.

313
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:41,761
So go right back to a sort of Jeremy Bentham utilitarianism.

314
00:32:41,761 --> 00:32:46,070
Why are you making people happier?

315
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,150
How much happier are you making them?

316
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:54,583
And what percent of that can you extract as economic surplus and what percent goes to them?

317
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:55,480
So, an interesting one is you pick Google.

318
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:59,360
There's lots of charts saying people would pay thousands and thousands of dollars for search.

319
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:02,780
Yet Google's ad revenue per person is much lower.

320
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:10,054
So potentially the utilitarian output of Google it's 10x, maybe even 20x, the economic value derived from that.

321
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:18,279
Whereas I imagine, if you look at something like Oracle, you would actually find the utilitarian benefits that’s economically created, and so much higher percent of the utilitarian benefits.

322
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:24,060
Like there's more value capture as a percentage of the total sum created than the total common utility.

323
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:31,340
But I think even when you're talking to a company at seed, you can sort of start to have that conversation over how big a problem are you solving?

324
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:34,009
How many people are you solving that for?

325
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:39,050
Or how much money have those institutions got to spend in your product, if it's an enterprise.

326
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,675
And then if that's utility created, that's part one, how big is that?

327
00:33:42,675 --> 00:33:45,560
And then two, is what are the competitive dynamics in this marketplace?

328
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:52,169
So how much of that utility will you capture and how much will just be given to your customers as consumer surplus.

329
00:33:52,459 --> 00:34:02,899
And one of the sort of interesting, wonderful tragedy of the economy of the last forty years, is there are so many companies, where 110% of the economic energy passed over to consumer surplus.

330
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:07,219
So you just have massive increases in living standards, sort of accidental Wikipedias.

331
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:13,870
So there's strange examples like LCD televisions, everyone switched from catheter tube to LCD in the early 2000s.

332
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:18,475
That's an increase in utility, but no TV companies make money because the market's too competitive.

333
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:23,319
Same with things like in consumer modems, laptops, switches.

334
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:30,020
You don't see 200 billion market cap companies like Intel, but we all benefit from far faster speeds than we did 20 years ago.

335
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:35,640
And so what you're looking, for as an investor is high utilitarian outcome, and the ability to capture it.

336
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:41,840
Patrick: Are there markers of that latter piece, the ability to catch it, that you see again and again, that interests you?

337
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,060
Charlie: Most extreme example is obviously network effects.

338
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,009
You get these in marketplaces.

339
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,540
You get them in anything with  Metcalf’s law.

340
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,699
You get some examples where, talking to a company today, you combine data from other companies to generate insights.

341
00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:02,359
So each time you get a new customer, you improve the product for all the existing customers, because you get a bigger data set to work on.

342
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,709
Strangely, I think spotting them has less use then spotting the fallacies.

343
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:16,219
If we go to data, there’s an amazing sort of last gasp of a company whose unit economics don't work, who says the values is in the data and 99% of the times that isn't true.

344
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:29,700
And the idea is that you've got unique dataset that's going to be incredibly value maybe for advertisers, maybe for other customers, maybe for enterprises, because the insights that could be generated, but it actually turns out most datasets will get you the same insight on people.

345
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:50,850
There was once a company, I don't know if this is true from first principles, but they said, if you gave them the last five browsing sites they’d been to, or the last five latitude/longitude locations they’d been to, or the last five Google search terms, or the last five credit card purchases, you could basically get to the same level of accuracy on that person's predicted behavior.

346
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:56,290
Which means there's a sort of false mirage of an Oasis, which is this going to be value in the data.

347
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,866
And it turns out to be mirage because there's so many other ways to get to that answer.

348
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:05,041
And so half the time what you're looking for is sort of the exact opposite, it’s where it appears there should be value capture, but there won't be.

349
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:05,446
[Highly boring, highly complex]

350
00:36:05,446 --> 00:36:13,580
Patrick: Patrick [00:36:05]: I asked once a group of people, what if any specific sector or category of companies they would invest in, if they could only choose one for the rest of their career.

351
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:20,650
And one person said communications, because you'll always have some monopoly to pick from, which is sort of a classic expression of the network effect idea.

352
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:27,190
Charlie: Charlie [00:36:21]: I'll go for, if you pick two axes, one co-axis is boredom and the other is complexity.

353
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,700
You want highly boring and highly complex.

354
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:37,470
Because everything in the universe is a supply and demand curve, and you just get insufficient supply of entrepreneurs in the highly boring but highly complex space.

355
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,220
And therefore you get elevated return.

356
00:36:39,229 --> 00:36:44,259
So if you go to the quadrants, you've sort of got the whole simple side, boring and simple, and complex and simple.

357
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,119
It's just too hard to get differentiation without enough complexity.

358
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,339
That's when you get commoditization.

359
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:51,979
If you go for interesting and complex, you get brilliant entrepreneurs.

360
00:36:52,299 --> 00:36:54,840
This is the problem say with Space Tech as an area of innovation.

361
00:36:55,030 --> 00:37:01,160
Every single person involved with space is basically a brilliant genius who's passionate about their work and loves it.

362
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:12,269
On the other hand, if you hang out in audit software, accounting software, just sitting in an area that's complex, but no one wants to boast they do it at a dinner party.

363
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:18,227
And what might call the sort of spiritual reward of the industry are lower, and therefore you just get less entrepreneurs.

364
00:37:18,227 --> 00:37:21,660
Therefore, the chance of having entrepreneurs succeeding is significantly higher.

365
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:31,910
Patrick: Patrick [00:37:22]: Do you think that two by two matrix squares with say the trillion dollar club today of Amazon and Apple and some of the FANG stocks, do you think that they generally were, at their start, boring?

366
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,810
Charlie: Charlie [00:37:32]: No.

367
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:41,720
I think it would more work in the sort of case of Salesforce, Workday, Tableau, Datadog, all those classic enterprise SAAS names.

368
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:51,500
I think the truly exceptional ones are so idiosyncratic that there's no way to find them because if they were predictable, you'd get so much competition they wouldn’t exist.

369
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:56,649
Interesting when you say Google, how many failed search companies proceeded them?

370
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:03,140
Alto Vista, Excite, Lycos, Infoseek, AskJeeves.

371
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:10,950
Imagine that someone sent you something about Google when it was a small company, you'd say, “ oh it's just another search engine.” In some ways you almost need the opposite.

372
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:14,120
You need a case for why it was so unobvious.

373
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:23,750
If you look at early Facebook, there's all these comments on “but surely MySpace has already won this market.” I think the exceptions are just so exceptional you can't formulate rules for them.

374
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,649
I think it's the next tier down where there's probably more repeatable behavior.

375
00:38:27,649 --> 00:38:31,600
Patrick: Patrick [00:38:28]: Of the 483 angel investments that you've made.

376
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,799
What percent would you say are clearly boring?

377
00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:37,660
Charlie: Charlie [00:38:35]: To whom would be the sort of counter question?

378
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:41,640
I think to sort of the average person, probably 350 of them.

379
00:38:41,969 --> 00:38:45,360
Obviously they're not boring to the founder and they're never boring to me.

380
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:51,960
I find things like accounting software deeply interesting because it's an intellectual puzzle, you're solving someone's problem.

381
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,790
And I also think that utilitarian output to the world is way underestimated in these things.

382
00:38:57,049 --> 00:39:01,810
If you were to think what was the precursor technology to Manhattan - sewers.

383
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,359
Very hard to have Manhattan without sewers.

384
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,009
But they don’t sound exciting, right?

385
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:13,250
If you were to somehow remove them, then human living standards would drop exponentially.

386
00:39:13,469 --> 00:39:21,550
And so those base technologies, sort of double entry accounting of the 14th century under the Medici or whoever, those things really matter.

387
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:25,070
That's sort of system-wide improvements to the thing.

388
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,374
Sometimes the joy of those can be missed.

389
00:39:27,374 --> 00:39:32,770
Patrick: Patrick [00:39:28]: Before we started recording, you mentioned this interesting word, which you don't often hear in investing, which is aesthetics.

390
00:39:32,889 --> 00:39:37,500
I'd love you to talk a bit about investor aesthetics, why they matter and why they may create bias.

391
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:43,460
Charlie: Charlie [00:39:38]: I think this is thing where if you think about the investing career, most people join a place where they fit.

392
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,350
And so they join an organization that gets them.

393
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,169
So you do have this sort of birds of a feather flock together.

394
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:56,660
So you tend to find that you get a set of people that either like the gritty and the real and the physical and the tangible.

395
00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:02,520
Look at, say the overlap between stock investors, looking at things like mining companies and shipping companies.

396
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:12,885
And then you get people that like the abstract and the sort of conceptual thinkers, think of Atlassian, Stripe, companies of that ilk.

397
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:18,790
Then I once saw this tweet, some joke about value investors that they love owning things with names like “American” is best off.

398
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,769
And it made me chuckle because it seemed that there was some sort of truth to that.

399
00:40:21,929 --> 00:40:35,129
It felt grittier and truer and more real and more like, just better to own something that's a steel mill plant Pittsburgh than it is to own a Tableau or some company doing this sort of weird software stuff.

400
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:39,920
And so the interesting trend about that is does that create biases and oversights?

401
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:53,359
So maybe because VC sort of in the 2010 to 2013, 2014, network effects consumer businesses were so good, maybe too much capital went into those in the subsequent years.

402
00:40:53,670 --> 00:41:00,560
I think of ride sharing and scooters and things like that, because there wasn't enough Darwinian survival people that focused on unit economics.

403
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:08,290
Those partners had diminished in their political power within the VC organization, versus the partners, the bet more on a network effect of the product.

404
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:16,029
There's actually a chapter in Dawkins’ Selfish Gene on hawks and doves and the emotionally stable populations of different behavioral strategies.

405
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,609
And maybe that also replicates in investors.

406
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:26,240
And of course, as an investing type succeeds, so it attracts more capital and more disciples and therefore there's more people looking for it.

407
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,100
And therefore the alpha is more diminished.

408
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,520
[Alien Investors]

409
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:33,570
Patrick: Patrick [00:41:29]: We've talked a lot about the founders and characters of entrepreneurs.

410
00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:40,040
Less so about characteristics of investors that you've worked with or seen operate, what are your observations there?

411
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:44,080
Probably haven't processed 483 of them in the same way, but I'm sure you've been around them.

412
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,470
What do you think makes for the right mix?

413
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,980
Charlie: Charlie [00:41:49]: Success is very idiosyncratic.

414
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:53,270
Rather like entrepreneurs, it's sort of finding a fit for that style.

415
00:41:53,460 --> 00:42:11,379
So I know one investor at seed, a fantastic investor, and just has the absolute essence of getting to the nub of the character of an entrepreneur, just the descriptions, the articulation, the strengths, the weaknesses, you would have thought she’d spent 300 hours doing the psychological profile.

416
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:16,000
It's sort of like those TV shows, when you have someone profile the serial killer in like 30 seconds.

417
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,649
It's almost sort of a gift for that.

418
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:30,460
Then there's another investor at the same stage who almost ignores the person as the founder and is all about the structural economics of the business, the market power, that ability to capture value.

419
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,460
Both those styles work beautifully.

420
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:37,020
And then I've seen a third type, which almost doesn't think about the underlying company.

421
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:42,740
What they actually watch is other investors and sort of like a pack of lions, they don't try and kill the antelope.

422
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:50,060
They just wait and swoop in and win deals that they saw other good investors go for.

423
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,270
So it's three wildly different strategies.

424
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,229
All three I've seen work superbly.

425
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:55,630
And so no cookie cutter solution.

426
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,154
[COVID Impacts]

427
00:42:56,154 --> 00:43:06,990
Patrick: Patrick [00:42:57]: I'd love to hear your take on the effects that COVID now three, four months into it are having on the world at large, both from a company standpoint and societal standpoint.

428
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:15,279
And at what point, sort of the behaviors that have changed become very set and in some way permanently change how we live.

429
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:17,390
Charlie: Charlie [00:43:16]: I see two main effects.

430
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,160
One is the sort of tech acceleration.

431
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:24,310
You've got this shift in behaviors that would have happened only over the long term from demographics.

432
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:33,670
As a sociologist at Microsoft once said, “There's a thing called a the Rule of 1975, which is people born before that just never had computers at school.

433
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:38,130
And so they'll never have the same intuitive behaviors as people born after that.”

434
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:44,200
And it's sort of the Einstein comment of : science advances one funeral at a time.

435
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:49,720
And so in some ways the natural movement progress is as generations of people get older.

436
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:51,410
Video gaming is a classic example of this.

437
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:56,189
It was seen as something only for kids, until those kids got older and kept on doing it.

438
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,810
I think COVID has changed that.

439
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:06,689
Because what you've had is 70 and 80 year olds get on and use Zoom and use digital apps in a way that was much more akin to 25 year olds.

440
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:09,800
That's a permanent one-off shift.

441
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,320
And you always see it in numbers for all e-commerce startups.

442
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,860
Every e-commerce startup, the numbers have gone insane.

443
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:22,110
To the point where you almost start wondering whether they've made a mistake because it can't be that good, that you can't get that fast in acceleration.

444
00:44:22,389 --> 00:44:24,290
But no, it really is that fast an acceleration.

445
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:30,826
And my guess is the emotional experience of retail will just be less appealing than it was.

446
00:44:30,826 --> 00:44:36,860
And so even in a world of re-opening, my guess is you get this continued elevation of e-commerce.

447
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:46,470
And then once people have shifted, from doing some activity like going to a bar to playing some video game competitively, probably a bigger percentage of that will stick.

448
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:50,520
And it seems obvious because this has lasted long enough that you get habit formation.

449
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:53,360
It's certainly longer than the 30 days that that's meant to take.

450
00:44:53,509 --> 00:44:58,150
Then there's a much more subtle impacts, which is you've definitely had a globalization of investing.

451
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:02,525
One of the things that never made any sense to me with investors that define themselves by geography.

452
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:11,460
So they were in Berlin and they invested in companies in Berlin, because the commonality in running a startup by geography seems almost de minimis.

453
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:23,860
Whereas the commonality of say FinTech globally, seems much more similar to each other, or quantum computing startups globally seems much more similar than a quantum computing company and a credit card company, both within a few streets of each other.

454
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:28,800
So it always seemed more logical to me, the startups to be defined by functional area, than by geography.

455
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:35,409
And that's starting to happen because if you're doing Zoom calls with someone, there's no difference whether they're a mile away from you or a thousand miles away.

456
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:37,200
And then the same with the labor pools.

457
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:42,650
Startups are starting to do remote in a way that was inconceivable before.

458
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:47,290
And what it started to do is make me think very deeply about where they can find talented people.

459
00:45:47,580 --> 00:46:01,210
Maybe I'm too optimistic, but I think that may just lead to a permanent shift in overall productivity upwards because you're putting together a team, not defined by the accidents of geography, but defined by finding the best people you can anywhere in the world.

460
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:06,810
And if everyone does that, you just have a bigger liquidity in every type of output.

461
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,780
And that leads to just a massively higher output function.

462
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:17,779
What are these changes in sort of demographics and the way we live now, it does seem that there's likely to be some sort of city to suburban transition.

463
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:31,569
And one of the things I like to do is sort of, I think history is really useful for investing because I think one of the mistakes you can make as a sort of temporal elegance of thinking the time one lives through it's sort of overly unique.

464
00:46:31,899 --> 00:46:40,240
There's a book by Will Durant called Caesar and Christ, it’s a whole history of Rome, from the founding to 500 AD and sort of the full history and afterwards.

465
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:42,770
So it's interesting to think, how would you invest through that?

466
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:47,090
Do you buy or sell Roman real estate when Caesar's murdered?

467
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:51,790
Cause you get a civil war and you get chaos, but then you get Augustus and peace afterwards.

468
00:46:51,940 --> 00:47:02,029
Then when you get this whole state of bad emperors and it looks like everything's going to fall apart, maybe you would sell and then you get Hadrian and the good emperors and you get a great hundred years.

469
00:47:02,259 --> 00:47:10,270
It makes you think about sort of volatility and about having to make decisions with only information available at that time.

470
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:23,009
And what's so interesting is, you do get this sort of pattern of going from a power and sort of fashion being to have your base in city of Rome, to being out in Capua or out in the smaller provinces.

471
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:28,130
And that cycle seems to co-exist for like the 500 years of history.

472
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,960
And if you look at London, I think the peak population was in the 1930s.

473
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,500
I think it's still higher than the present population.

474
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:42,630
Or it may just have peaked so maybe that's the beginning of one of these great 40 year demographic changes, but people move back to the suburbs or not.

475
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,959
This is speculation.

476
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:48,339
I certainly don't have as much conviction on it as I do on startup stuff.

477
00:47:48,339 --> 00:47:51,549
Patrick: Patrick [00:47:49]: What do you make on the other end of that barbell?

478
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:56,279
So certainly agree that the far off collaboration is probably going to permanently change.

479
00:47:56,429 --> 00:48:07,290
I've seen it happen just personally in many examples where now you don't care where the person is zooming in from, it opens up an enormous pool of talent and you seem ridiculous for not having tried to tap that earlier.

480
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:09,700
The other extreme would be like hyper local.

481
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:12,170
What I've also noticed is the middle is gone.

482
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:18,169
New York city for me, which is 50 minutes away is way less relevant, but my town is now way more relevant and the people in it.

483
00:48:18,389 --> 00:48:24,779
Do you think there's investing opportunity there or I would just be curious for any thoughts you have on kind of the local community versus the distance zoom.

484
00:48:24,779 --> 00:48:28,540
Charlie: Charlie [00:48:25]: I'm sadly out of insight on it.

485
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:31,980
But I think your intuitively right in predicting the outcome.

486
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:43,000
I think one of the things that's going to be very interesting is I do think there's this sort of U shape curve, where for companies, you either have to be remote, or you have to be centralized.

487
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:55,509
The bit that's going to be absolutely nightmarish is if you have a hybrid mix, because what that'll lead to is everyone at head quarters will have a political advantage over everyone that works remotely.

488
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:02,149
And so you'll end up promoting people who chose to move to headquarters, rather than work remotely.

489
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:09,643
So you'll end up promoting the more politically aware, which is probably the most toxic criteria you could have for long-term productivity of the firm.

490
00:49:09,643 --> 00:49:09,672
Patrick: [Crypto]

491
00:49:09,672 --> 00:49:17,150
Patrick [00:49:12]: As a quick aside, Sarah told me to ask you about crypto and farmland.

492
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:21,380
And I'm curious if those were meant to be topics that are grouped together in your mind or separate.

493
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,230
And of course, I'm interested in your thoughts on both.

494
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:30,500
Charlie: Charlie [00:49:24]: Crypto is super interesting because it's so un-analogous to anything that's come before it.

495
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:37,000
So one of the interesting things with investing is people get a dopamine effect from things they've made money on before.

496
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:42,940
And so they like to invest in similar things or at least things that their friends made money from before so they think there will be a dopamine hit.

497
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:50,410
So if you look at decks and startups in 2016, you'd be amazed how often the Uber of, or Airbnb of appear.

498
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:58,319
That's sort of a marketing ploy to say you're going to get the dopamine effect investing in the business that is similar to these existing successes.

499
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:04,029
Once every so often you get something that just sort of has no epistemological priors.

500
00:50:04,029 --> 00:50:05,629
There's just nothing like it before.

501
00:50:05,799 --> 00:50:07,450
And I think crypto has that.

502
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:14,190
And then what's so interesting about crypto is it has such strong psychological Rorschach tests.

503
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:20,950
So the biggest variable I've seen amongst people I know of whether they believe something like a Bitcoin is viable is age.

504
00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:23,540
In a way that I don't see for any other element of tech.

505
00:50:23,709 --> 00:50:27,690
Younger people find digital money, more intuitive, older people find it less so.

506
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:31,130
There may also be something subtle there about the strength of the nation state.

507
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:35,759
Then US investors find it less intuitive than non-US investors.

508
00:50:35,849 --> 00:50:43,099
Because they think of the US government say banning crypto like FDR confiscated gold, they think of it as unlikely.

509
00:50:43,229 --> 00:50:50,839
Where, if they're from a country like Belgium, it's less obvious that your government really has the capability to do something like ban crypto.

510
00:50:51,030 --> 00:51:00,009
So all these strange variables, like the size of the country you're in and the government capability, affect your conception of its viability.

511
00:51:00,049 --> 00:51:08,490
Charlie [00:51:08]: And then it's also interesting within crypto itself that you have these two major platforms, Bitcoin and Ethereum, and they sort of attract different investor types.

512
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:24,910
So Bitcoin's got the sort of association almost with Austrian monetary policy, with sort of gold, with preservation of value, with this sort of trust minimized sort of slightly dark, almost Gothic view of humanity and sort of Bitcoin as a sort of place to go to safety.

513
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:36,470
Whereas Ethereum is much more sort of visionary about DeFi changing staff, much more software, much more network effects, much less consciousness of trust and store of value.

514
00:51:36,549 --> 00:51:39,710
And you start to see the sort of bickering between those two cultures.

515
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:43,680
And it's fascinating how you've got two sort of s points of shilling points.

516
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:49,830
Not only are they shilling points at an economic level, but they are also showing points for investor personality types that go into them.

517
00:51:49,950 --> 00:52:01,830
What's interesting is if they continue to do that, they probably diverged far enough that there's no longer in fact, any competition between them, because they've diverged so much culturally and in their aspirations that they're no longer direct competitors.

518
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:05,769
One of the things that sort of interest me is how is wealth preserved over time.

519
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:09,710
And if you look at one of the best stores of value, it was forestry.

520
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,069
And there's two very interesting attributes to forestry.

521
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:15,609
One is it's so boring, no one ever bothers to seize it.

522
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:31,650
So if you look at people that were in a country on the wrong side of a war and occupied by an invading power over the last thousand years, things like houses and artworks were confiscated, things that businesses were nationalized, no one ever thought about forestry.

523
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,715
It just sort of slid under the radar.

524
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:41,140
And then the second interesting attributes of it was that the cash flow characteristics are so terrible, you have to wait 50 years for trees to grow.

525
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:52,860
You've got very few investors and very few corporations doing it because imagine building an Excel model, showing the payback in 51 years, that's really sort of only 2 to 3% of your principal.

526
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:55,200
It's so appalling you never go into it.

527
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:59,290
And therefore it had these characteristics and did work superbly well.

528
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:11,770
It's sort of interesting to think what are the digital equivalents of things that have some psychological repellants to them and therefore actually will have great economic capture because there's something unappealing about them.

529
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:18,010
Patrick: Patrick [00:53:12]: What do you think some of the best examples of that last concept are digital equivalents of repelling assets?

530
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:24,629
Charlie: Charlie [00:53:18]: I think certainly up to 2017 crypto had that, it's such a strange topic.

531
00:53:24,789 --> 00:53:30,180
The association with things like Mount Gox and fraud and things just made it slightly sketchy.

532
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:36,050
And then the abstraction, that the lack of physical reality of it, I think makes it unintuitive to people.

533
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:36,870
You can't touch it.

534
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:37,769
You can't feel it.

535
00:53:38,009 --> 00:53:40,220
It's sort of numbers in the sky.

536
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,649
Things like that just don't have psychological appeal.

537
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,272
And that absence psychological appeal is a source of alpha.

538
00:53:46,272 --> 00:53:46,603
[Mis-valued Assets]

539
00:53:46,603 --> 00:53:50,569
Patrick: Patrick [00:53:47]: What do you think the most mis-valued asset in the world is today?

540
00:53:50,569 --> 00:53:58,220
Charlie: Charlie [00:53:51]: I would say it's probably entrepreneurs in markets that are non-obvious.

541
00:53:58,629 --> 00:54:01,129
And I don't mean because their end market is not obvious.

542
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:10,969
It's people addressing global problems, but in some secondary city in Romania, because capital markets at that stage, are just not efficient enough to find them.

543
00:54:10,969 --> 00:54:12,550
There's a famous company, UI path.

544
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:15,060
I think now worth about 10 billion, that came out of Romania.

545
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,229
And so there's a dramatic example of that.

546
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:21,560
I think if you were to say, well, where is there a core option?

547
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,549
It's probably something in crypto.

548
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:25,840
It may exist or it may not exist.

549
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:33,930
I think one of the great questions is, is everything in that space now in the Lycos/Alta Vista high cost space or is it at the Google and Amazon stage?

550
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:52,150
That's a very hard question to answer in foresight, irritating obvious in hindsight, but it does seem there's a probability mass of something being very big there because there's something about finance where it's demarcated by nation state, even though it's a pure electronic good.

551
00:54:52,330 --> 00:55:07,159
And so, anything that's just pure numbers in the sky should actually be globally scalable, but it isn't because of the existing finance regulatory environment and the existing historical paths, sort of banks when they were physical institutions.

552
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:14,640
That makes me think this globalization of finance has the potential for multiple trillion dollar market cap companies over the next decades.

553
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:19,100
Patrick: Patrick [00:55:15]: You mentioned Romania, which just makes me think of Europe more broadly speaking.

554
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:23,759
I'd be curious your relative take on opportunity in Europe for business and investing.

555
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:29,180
When the last decade has been relatively underwhelming, certainly relative to the performance of us companies.

556
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:38,100
Charlie: Charlie [00:55:30]: It is amazing that if you look at the top 10, maybe even the top 20 by now, companies in the world by market cap, they're exclusively US and China.

557
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,420
That’s an absolutely fascinating stats and says so much about the last 10 years.

558
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:52,040
There's a very sort of dark line of thought, which says one of the best things about Europe is that you probably have a less geopolitical risk than any other place.

559
00:55:52,230 --> 00:56:00,294
There's something about the horrors of Somme, Verdun and Stalingrad that makes it some unimaginable for Germany and France to have a conflict.

560
00:56:00,294 --> 00:56:07,170
Whereas, as I think it is much more imaginable to have China, India, US those sort of countries have conflict.

561
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:13,870
So in some ways, one of the things you have in Europe is a sort of absence of systemic risk of wipe out.

562
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:17,939
Because if you look at what really destroys investing returns, it's geopolitical conflict.

563
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:24,630
If you look at the collapse of European wealth in World War One, World War Two, it's just absolutely epic.

564
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:27,665
And I think that may be an under-priced benefit of Europe.

565
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:44,640
I think the other much more cheerful and practical one, is there are countries with institutions weren't developed enough to build a Google, arguably that's every other country apart from the US, but I think it is certainly true of very small European countries because they just don't have the complexity of legal system.

566
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,150
They don't obviously have a means of going public.

567
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:51,370
They don't have the institutional norms or the depth of financing or anything like that.

568
00:56:51,520 --> 00:57:04,480
But now I see so many companies come out of Europe that are Delaware corporations LLCs, that have say West Coast investors, the legal documents by Wilson Sonsini or some other US firm.

569
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:28,340
And you have this amazing mix of sort of Soviet quality education, which is very high in math and logic, post-Soviet GDP per head, which basically means your capital goes very far, but with US high trust institutions acting to sort of scale it to the corporation and that unique coming together, feels special.

570
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,799
Patrick: Patrick [00:57:29]: It's a fascinating take on everything.

571
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:37,560
I mean, I had never considered really any of those angles, again appealing to the 483 companies that you've invested in.

572
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,100
I'd love to know the geographic dispersion of those things generally speaking,

573
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:57,030
Charlie: Charlie [00:57:41]: Almost an even mix between US, UK, continental Europe would account for 90% with the remaining 10% scattered in Asia, Africa, Latin America, with the particular hub in Singapore, because of an incubator called Entrepreneurs First that I invest in with a great deal.

574
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:57,423
Patrick: Patrick [00:57:57]: Yeah.

575
00:57:57,590 --> 00:57:59,960
I've had Matt on the show, which was a fantastic episode.

576
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:02,480
I love his idea of the history of the technology of ambition.

577
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:10,060
Charlie: Charlie [00:58:03]: It's completely Matt's IP, which was, it's very interesting to think where talented people go as a framework.

578
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:15,610
And so, if you go back and go the other way and say, what can you learn from investing when you look at history.

579
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:27,920
It's interesting to think what is underestimated because of the decline of some institution, not all the stuff people think about when they wrote about it, but just that very talented people who are young chose to go a different direction.

580
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:34,540
So there was a time when you're a young man and you can choose, do I go and do an administration of a Roman province?

581
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:36,380
Or do I join the early Christian church?

582
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:41,839
Possibly the talent started to flow towards the church and away from Roman institutions and that actually caused a weakening.

583
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:46,159
That is a generalized framework of where exceptional talent choose to go is super interesting.

584
00:58:46,320 --> 00:59:01,089
So one thought that occurs in our world is perhaps the sort of investment banks and consulting firms and law firms of tomorrow will be much less good than their precursors 20, 30 years ago, because so many talented people are going into entrepreneurship and that talent has to pull out of somewhere.

585
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:16,210
Now, I think again, from a sort of societal viewpoint, I think putting talented people, in things that can scale their products to millions of people is higher utility than putting them in effectively in a high end artisan perfection like consulting or the law where the output doesn't scale.

586
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:16,213
[Information Curation]

587
00:59:16,213 --> 00:59:24,190
Patrick: Patrick [00:59:16]: It seems to me that a lot of what you're doing with your life and career is curation of people, ideas, companies, history.

588
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:26,510
I mean so many different examples in our conversation today.

589
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:36,200
I'd love you to riff on that idea of curation and whether or not it's going to become an increasingly important skill in a world that is exploding with information and content and data.

590
00:59:37,149 --> 00:59:44,000
Charlie: Charlie [00:59:37]: Very simply as if you think back to sort of 30 years ago, your basic problem is lack of information.

591
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:51,290
So you sort of read about capital markets investors in the 1990s, and they are reading SEC filings, reading sell side reports.

592
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:55,244
They're trying to get time with management, but it's a fundamental lack of information problem.

593
00:59:55,244 --> 00:59:55,805
[“If you hang out with people smarter, harder working, and morally better than oneself, you always live in a funnel of positive serendipity because effectively you are dragged upwards to the mean benchmark, which is higher than oneself.”]

594
00:59:55,820 --> 01:00:02,010
Now you look at the massive growth of available information, and I think it becomes much more of a filtering problem.

595
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:11,060
And in some ways, the best way to filter is to have second stage filters before your filter, which is just to find amazing people and use them as filter points.

596
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:28,240
So there's a sort of phase, which is: “if you hang out with people smarter, harder working, and morally better than oneself, you always live in a funnel of positive serendipity because effectively you are dragged upwards to the mean benchmark, which is higher than oneself.” So that's what I try to do.

597
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,589
Patrick: Patrick [01:00:29]: You just described my whole life.

598
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:34,270
I'm playing with this idea now of it's better to be interested than interesting.

599
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:40,859
And if someone that's never been particularly interesting, a great way to eventually become interesting is to be purely interested all the time.

600
01:00:40,859 --> 01:00:41,870
Charlie: Charlie [01:00:41]: Yes.

601
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:42,790
A hundred percent.

602
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:54,349
And I think Patrick, if you could overlay amazing people in a unique configuration, you get an information for you that is both a accretive to you, it pulls you up, but it's also a unique lens in the world.

603
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:56,962
And from unique lenses, you get unique opportunities.

604
01:00:56,962 --> 01:00:58,190
Patrick: Patrick [01:00:57]: By that.

605
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:03,420
Do you just mean non-overlapping kind of backgrounds and areas of interest in the people in your network?

606
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:04,200
Charlie: Charlie [01:01:03]: Yeah.

607
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:09,259
And one of the ones that I think is always fascinates me is just have geographically disparate networks.

608
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:16,310
Often you get these very sort of tight communities in some ways, the Valley, in some ways, sort of New York, say the hedge fund community.

609
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:26,030
Sometimes the most obvious insights are just from going between one to the other and just seeing the difference in worldviews in stark relief from each other.

610
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:28,199
And so I sort of think about that constantly.

611
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:40,000
I mean, one of the ones that's most powerful is just imagine thinking about the same problem, not from a US perspective, but from say a Finnish perspective on our Albanian perspective.

612
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:43,490
And suddenly topics look very different.

613
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:49,530
And there's a danger of defaulting to this, because the US is sort of the world hegemon, to defaulting to that mindset.

614
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:52,645
And that's not always the best, most predictive view.

615
01:01:52,645 --> 01:01:53,051
[Temporal Inevitability]

616
01:01:53,051 --> 01:01:54,740
Patrick: Patrick [01:01:53]: We've talked about a lot.

617
01:01:54,990 --> 01:02:00,570
And as we wind down, I'm curious what topic that we haven't talked about at all you are most interested in.

618
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:06,329
Charlie: Charlie [01:02:01]: Of course, after we finish this, I'll think of tons, but I'm sort of failing to think of anything in the moment.

619
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:17,920
I think there's one I would pick it would be, and one of the things that's sort of fascinating in sort of the history of tech, is how much startups are temporal inevitabilities.

620
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:27,720
So as a phrase someone one said to me, what's the difference between a heretic and a prophet in tech, the heretic gets burned at the stake, the prophet becomes famous - about two years.

621
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:33,729
And you sometimes wonder how much timing matters.

622
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:46,310
Was a site like Pinterest, always going to exist within a year, that you could download a page of images on the internet in under a hundred milliseconds, was that the sort of temporal inevitability of a product like that?

623
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:49,520
And is it the same for most products?

624
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:57,800
For GPS and mobile phone, did that make an Uber like thing inevitable in around 2009, 2010?

625
01:02:58,119 --> 01:02:58,752
One of the greater moments is the temporal one.

626
01:02:58,752 --> 01:03:11,720
And then I think the other sort of great unknown is how much of value is actually created for the top layers of the stack by the bottom layers that don't capture it.

627
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:14,630
So are we all just the beneficiaries?

628
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:33,110
Is angel investing just the beneficiary of the emergence of AWS and Azure, because I can tell a story whereby angel investing just didn't exist because it was negative ROIC, because you have spent so much on SUN Microsystems servers and sort of physical equipment that you've just had poor IRR across the whole industry.

629
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:41,230
Then AWS and Azure come along, and critically as a startup, you don't know your own future demand curve because you don't know what you're going to get put on market fit.

630
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:46,600
So you either have to buy too many servers in which case you waste capital or too few, in which case you couldn't meet demand.

631
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:51,620
Whereas with AWS and Azure, they've effectively taken that risk out of the equation.

632
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:55,149
And you can almost know that your cost base only scales with your success.

633
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:57,820
Is the entire industry just sitting on that?

634
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:00,720
Kind of an intuitive feel but it probably is.

635
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:01,770
Better lucky than good.

636
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:08,200
Maybe we get an AI boom in the next couple of years, maybe that would be written about as ML.

637
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:18,460
Maybe it's actually, and Nvidia’s chips and emergence sort of five and seven nanometer nodes, which just drive improvements in throughput that drives ML up.

638
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:21,390
So it's nothing to do with the companies that are actually working on it.

639
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:27,219
It's to do with sort of the pickaxes being turned from wood to iron, making their work far more efficient.

640
01:04:27,379 --> 01:04:31,920
And, Nvidia will probably capture some value of that, but probably won't capture the greatest value.

641
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:47,459
Same if you were to do sort of history of early computing 90s and 2000s, would be interesting to write it from the importance of the evolution of Intel chips and modem speeds as the primary drivers, as opposed to the narrative of history of the growth of these great companies.

642
01:04:47,459 --> 01:04:57,660
Patrick: Patrick [01:04:48]: Well, Charlie, I feel like I could do this with you almost weekly basis, sort of endlessly entertained by your prolific interest in so many different things.

643
01:04:57,830 --> 01:05:02,369
I'll certainly remember this conversation as one, that's a reminder that investing in business are complicated.

644
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:10,490
And if you want to spend your career in those spaces, you better love it because there are so many variables and so many things happening and you have to develop your own niche and your own strategy.

645
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:16,410
My closing question for everybody in each of these conversations is to ask for the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you.

646
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:20,742
Charlie: Charlie [01:05:17]: Oh my God, there are so many.

647
01:05:20,742 --> 01:05:22,439
There are so many examples.

648
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:34,534
I think it's probably a recurrent one of often my enthusiasm has been greater than my competence and it's the people that bet on the enthusiasm more than the competence.

649
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:36,110
I'm internally grateful to them.

650
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:37,939
Patrick: Patrick [01:05:37]: I love that.

651
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,190
Again, you're sometimes describing my life.

652
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:42,770
So I know exactly what you mean, and it is a wonderful thing.

653
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:50,089
And a major category of these answers is betting on somebody early, seeing something in them and taking that risk is always a great kindness.

654
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:57,239
Well, Charlie, this has been a highlight of my early week, even though it's just Monday, I really appreciate your time and I've loved all your insight.

655
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:57,670
Thank you.

656
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:06,380
Charlie: Charlie [01:05:57]: Thank you.
